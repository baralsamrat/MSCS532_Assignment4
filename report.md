## Complexity Analysis

### 1.	Heapsort:
	•	Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases due to repeated heapify operations on log n levels.
	•	Space Complexity: O(1) since Heapsort is in-place (no additional memory required).
 
 ### 2.	Quicksort:
	•	Time Complexity:
	•	Best/Average Case: O(n log n)
	•	Worst Case: O(n^2) (if the pivot is poorly chosen, e.g., sorted input).
	•	Space Complexity: O(log n) due to recursive calls.
 
 ### 3.	Merge Sort:
	•	Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
	•	Space Complexity: O(n) because of additional arrays created during the merging process.
